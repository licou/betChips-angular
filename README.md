# betChips-angular

FYC : This is a project that will be a part of 3 others, that will all do the same things, but with differents javascript frameworks (backbone.js and ember.js will follow).

This application is responsible for mobile device.

This SPA allows you to place a bet on a the current bitcoin value (that is refreshed by ajax request).
You start the journey with 100 chips on your wallet.
You bet that in "x" seconds the current bitcoins value will increase or decrease. 
When the bet is placed you can see a countdown timer on your bet untill the x seconds are reached, a notice is shown if you are loosing or winning (you have the right to remove your bet)
it displays you bet history, the bitcoins value history.

This app has been realized with angular.js v 1.4.3. it could be improve with a node.js sever that serves the current bitcoin value with websocket to the SPA.
